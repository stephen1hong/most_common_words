How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?\\nIt's not because John McCain doesn't care.,  She's the one who taught me about hard work.,  She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life., \\nThat's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.,  Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism., \\nFor eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past., \\nAmerica, this is one of those moments.,  That together, our dreams can be one., \\nAnd I think that we face one of those moments today., \\nThat if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams., \\nThat if you say the words \"plan for victory\" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.,  We just didn't know he was talking about this one., \\nBut there's just one problem.,  The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families., \\nAt one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school., \\nAnd I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see? Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in? Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country? Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?\\nWe are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say \"yes\" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.,  In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else., \\nIt can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.,  And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.,  The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.,  Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place., \\nOf course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see., \\nThese are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ? a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region.,  Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security., \\nI have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one., \\nLet me emphasize one vital point ? any U., \\nThere is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.,  I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today., \\nNow, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip., \\nBut this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.,  As one book says, \"disease by the ton was its industry.,  By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference., \\nThis does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.]</td>\n",

a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.,  It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust., \\nThe time for waiting in Iraq is over.,  It is time to change our policy.,  It is time to give Iraqis their country back.,  And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won., \\nBut this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater., \\nToday, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.,  But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan., \\nTime and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.]</td>\n",

that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided., \\nThe second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success., \"\\nBesides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U., \\nAdditional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.,  For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.,  I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly., \\nWe also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.,  \"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved.]</td>\n",

How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?

How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?\\nIt's not because John McCain doesn't care.,  She's the one who taught me about hard work.,  She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life., \\nThat's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.,  Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism., \\nFor eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past., \\nAmerica, this is one of those moments.,  That together, our dreams can be one.,  In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else., \\nIt can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.,  And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.,  The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.,  Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place., \\nOf course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see., \\nNow, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip., \\nBut this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.,  As one book says, \"disease by the ton was its industry.,  By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference., \\nThis does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[ It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.,  But let me tell you how I came to be here.,  As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.,  I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.,  I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.,  And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.,  I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.,  I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill., \\nIt was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith., \\nAfter three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.,  I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.,  It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator., \\nIt was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.,  I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today., \\nIt was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America., \\nAnd that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States., \\nI recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.,  I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.,  I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.,  Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.,  I thought it was a tragic mistake.,  That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008., \\nI know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.,  I understand the skepticism.,  After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different., \\nI want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity., \\nI want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all., \\nI want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America., \\nAnd if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.,  I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences., \\nWhen I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil., \\nNow, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus.,  I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus.,  And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.,  The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question., \\nI have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one., \\nWhen I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006., \\nI am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid., \\nAnd so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.,  But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.,  And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.,  In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.,  And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.,  I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.,  I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.]</td>\n",

diplomatic, economic, and military ? to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it., \\nIn each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ? a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful.,  The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ? in North Korea, in Iran, and in Afghanistan.,  Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.,  And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.,  No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ? and that strategy must change.,  The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels., \\nDrawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.,  This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.,  commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support.,  We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.,  It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.,  As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism., \\nThe overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world., \\nThere is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.,  9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.]</td>\n",
